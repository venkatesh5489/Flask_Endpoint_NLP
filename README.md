Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Flask API Endpoint
Overview
This repository contains a Flask API endpoint for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

Features
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of tweets using a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of labeled tweets.
Flask API Endpoint: A RESTful API endpoint that accepts a tweet text as input and returns the sentiment analysis result.
Easy Integration: Integrate the API endpoint into your application to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Flask 2.0+
NLTK library for NLP tasks
Scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks
Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/venkatesh5489/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_with_Flask_API_Endpoint.git
Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application: python app.py
API Endpoint
The API endpoint is available at http://localhost:5000/sentiment. You can send a POST request with a JSON payload containing the tweet text to analyze:

{
  "tweet": "I love this product!"
}
		
The API will respond with a JSON object containing the sentiment analysis result:

{
  "sentiment": "positive"
}
		
Example Use Cases
Social Media Monitoring: Integrate the API endpoint into your social media monitoring tool to analyze the sentiment of customer feedback on Twitter.
Market Research: Use the API to analyze the sentiment of tweets related to your brand or product to gain insights into customer opinions.
Chatbots: Integrate the API into your chatbot to analyze the sentiment of user input and respond accordingly.
Model Performance
The sentiment analysis model used in this repository has been trained on a large dataset of labeled tweets and has achieved an accuracy of 85% on a test set.

Future Work
Improving Model Performance: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and techniques to improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis model.
Expanding to Other Social Media Platforms: Develop API endpoints for sentiment analysis on other social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.
